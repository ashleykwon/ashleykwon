    <h2>Contemporary Art Recommendation System</h2>

    <h3>Context and Problem</h3>
    <p>
        Studying about careers of contemporary artists, I realized that achieving the status as 
        a “pioneer” artist is correlated more with joining a network of 
        influential dealers and obtaining exhibition opportunities 
        at a few major art institutions than with creativity and artistic skills. 
        These findings inspired me to design a new kind of platform for artists 
        in “peripheral” communities with limited access to renowned art institutions and dealers. 
        The goal was to raise awareness about their work.

    <h3>Art Recommendation System</h3>    
    <p>
        As a part of my senior thesis project for art history under the supervision of Prof. Bill Seaman, 
        I built a website that recommends artworks of young contemporary artists 
        based on users’ preferences in terms of extrinsic and intrinsic characteristics of artworks. 
        The backend program of the website draws its inspiration from human brains’ visual processing steps, 
        which, according to Eric Kandel’s book, 
        <i><a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12263681-the-age-of-insight">The Age of Insight</a></i>, 
        involves perceiving colors first and then edges and finally recognizing specific objects. 
        The program abstracts and re-purposes algorithms in computer vision such as Haralick texture analysis, 
        edge detection, and object detection to numerically characterize visible characteristics of artworks. 
        It also uses recommendation techniques involving textual tags to capture 
        invisible qualities such as creative purposes and artistic movements.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        This project was a great opportunity for me to use an interdisciplinary approach, 
        involving research in art history, computer science, and neuroscience, 
        to address an issue that underrepresented groups of young artists face. 
        Through this project, I earned the honors of graduating from Duke University with distinction in art history and 
        receiving the Visual and Media Studies Award, which is presented annually to recognize an outstanding senior undergraduate student at Duke 
        who conducted original research in Visual and Media Studies.
