            <h3>Context and Problem</h3>
            <p>
                As a painting ages, parts of its pigment layers fall off or lose their original colors, 
                due to chemical interactions with the surrounding environment. 
                To repair a damaged painting, 
                art conservators and restorers fill in its areas of paint loss or repaint discolored areas. 
                Identifying the pigments used when creating a painting as well as differentiating 
                between retouched and original areas of a painting are crucial in preserving it, 
                reviving it, and understanding its history.

            <h3>Macro XRF in the Context of Art Investigation</h3>
            <p>
                In recent decades, non-invasive material detection techniques 
                (e.g. X-ray fluorescence, abbreviated as XRF) have gained attention throughout the cultural 
                heritage scientific community. 
                In the context of art conservation, these techniques allow the detection of 
                elements present in paintings under study. 
                More precisely, algorithms designed for material detection process the XRF “data cube” 
                and provide elemental maps as in the image above indicating the presence of 
                various elements across a painting. 
                However, even with the help of elemental maps, it is still 
                a challenging task to identify pigments (compounds or 
                mixtures of compounds that consist of several elements)
                and distinguish retouched areas, based on the scrutiny of elemental maps one by one.

            <h3>Mathematical Optimization Model for Pigment Map Generation</h3>
            <p>
                Under the guidance of Prof. Barak Sober, a former mathematics professor at Duke University, 
                I developed an algorithm that takes as its inputs elemental maps of a painting
                and the painting's RGB image to generate 
                images showing areas where certain pigments were used. 
                 These images can be used by art investigators to both 
                 “read” the pigments that the artist used to create the painting 
                 and identify retouches or fills in an automatic fashion.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                We presented this project in a poster at the International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP) in August 2022. 
                The poster was selected for a spotlight talk, which you can watch <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nyuf_ebHQUU">here</a>.
