    <h2>AR-based Labeling for DNN Fine-tuning</h2>
            
    <h3>Context and Problem</h3>
    <p>
        Augmented reality (AR), a technology that superimposes virtual elements 
        on a real-life view, has recently been integrated into object detection. 
        Despite object detection models' increasing accuracies, 
        humans still need to label images in their training datasets. 
        This is a time-consuming process that involves manually drawing bounding boxes 
        around specific objects in images and associating these boxes with labels.

    <h3>AR-based Object Labeling</h3>
    <p>
        As a part of my senior thesis project in computer science under the supervision of 
        Prof. Maria Gorlatova, I designed a smartphone AR application where a user 
        and a fine-tuned object detection and segmentation model, 
        Faster RCNN, collaboratively generate labels of lemur images 
        to shorten the amount of labeling time. 
        With the Faster RCNN model suggesting possible labels for lemurs detected 
        from the smartphoneâ€™s camera, the user only needs to indicate, 
        using buttons in the application's UI, 
        whether the labels are correct and select the correct labels 
        if the suggested ones are incorrect.

    <h3>Reducing Latency in Label Generation</h3>

    <p>
        To reduce the latency caused by running computation-heavy programs 
        like inferences with Faster RCNN on a smartphone, 
        I also built a pipeline that splits the label generation task
        between a smartphone and an edge. 
        In this pipeline, which I visualized above, the smartphone AR application sends captured frames to the edge. 
        Stored in the edge is a program that takes the frames as 
        inputs and generates labels of lemurs detected in the frames using 
        a fine-tuned Faster RCNN model. The program sends the labels back to the smartphone application 
        so that the application can display the suggested labels for the user to confirm.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        It is commonly known that recently developed technologies such as 
        object detection often require costly electronic devices with large storage spaces 
        and computing power. 
        This project started my interest in making such technologies 
        more readily available to users of lower end but more widespread 
        electronic devices like smartphones. Through this project, I also 
        earned the honor of graduating from Duke University with <a href = "https://www.cs.duke.edu/news/articles/4144">high distinction in computer science</a>.
