            <h3>Context and Problem</h3>
            <p>
                Knowledge about characteristics of user movements in virtual reality (VR) systems is crucial 
                in addressing issues that these systems are known to cause such as nausea. 
                However, despite the increasing number of VR applications for diverse electronic devices, 
                there have not been many user movement data collected from them. 
            </p>
                <br><br>
            <h3>Collecting User Movement Data in VR Games</h3>
            <p>
                My research mentor, Ying Chen, at the Intelligent Interactive Internet of Things (I3T) 
                lab and I designed three desktop VR games, using packages from the Unity store, 
                where users can explore different VR scenes using the arrow keys for translational 
                movement and the mouse for viewpoint movement. 
                We also added a script to each game that collects users' coordinate and viewpoint orientation 
                data for each frame in the VR games. 
                Using these games, we obtained movement data from 15+ users collected over 240 minutes.
                <br><br>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                As a result of this project, we produced statistical models for user position and orientation in VR systems, 
                which, to our best knowledge, is the first one to characterize user movements in VR systems in 
                various electronic devices, including a desktop computer. 
                We reported our discoveries and datasets in a conference paper, 
                <a href = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.04060.pdf">VR Viewport Pose Model for Quantifying and Exploiting Frame Correlations</a>,
                    which was presented at the IEEE INFOCOM in 2022.
                <br><br>
                While interacting users with different levels of exposure to VR technologies 
                in the data collection process, 
                I appreciated receiving their feedback and hearing their opinions about VR technologies. 
                This project inspired me to make cutting-edge technologies accessible to diverse groups of people, 
                including those that have never had any previous interactions with them.
